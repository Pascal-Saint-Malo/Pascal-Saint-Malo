I like automation or process supervision
  my little part :with any app but more precisely with
    Pascal (History), Python, Sql, wy not R-cran, C++, ...
with the three phases (summary)
  analysis : paper-and-pencil method around a table with all the actors
  design of a "realistic" monitoring of expected results
  definition of supervisory tools
in these three (recursive) phases all knowledge about all materials-tools-software comes into play
